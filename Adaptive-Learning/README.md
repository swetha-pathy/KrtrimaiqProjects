**Description**

Student assessment with adaptive learning enables students to take tests customised according to their performance in the previous test. User levels are assigned to the students based on their performance. User levels are Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.

The composition of easy, medium and hard questions in the question paper depends on the user level of the student. For example, a student with Advanced user level gets more hard questions in their test compared to a Beginner or Intermediate student. A first-time student will be given a generic question paper with equal number of easy, medium and hard questions.

This application comprises of an **Admin portal** and a **student portal.**

**Admin portal**

1. The admin can set the percentage composition of easy, medium and hard questions for each user level. The admin can also view the current percentages of easy, medium, hard questions for the user levels.
2. The admin can set the qualification score limit that classifies the student into Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced levels. The current values of the same can also be viewed.
3. The admin can upload the questions in the form of a csv for the generation of the question paper.

**Student portal**

The student takes the assessment in the student portal.

Students can take 2 types of assessments:

1. Student generated assessment: Here the student has the liberty to specify the percentages of easy, medium and hard questions to appear in the test. They can also select the subject and the chapter.
2. Admin generated assessment: The question paper is generated based on the parameters specified by the admin in the admin portal. The student only has to select the subject and the chapter.
